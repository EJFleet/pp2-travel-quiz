## Design

### Flowchart

Before starting to code, I designed a flowchart with [Lucid](www.lucid.app) to visualise how a user would move through the app and to break down exactly what needed to be done.

## Features



### Header

#### Mobile
![Header for mobile](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-header-mobile.png)

#### Desktop
![Header for desktop](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-header-full.png)


### Footer

#### Mobile
![Footer for mobile](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-footer-mobile.png)

#### Desktop
![Footer for desktop](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-footer-desktop.png)

The footer contains links to Joan's social media, using icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).  There are also contact details for her acting agency and a line that credits me as the designer and links to my GitHub.

As with the header, the footer stretches across the whole screen to give a framing effect.

### Favicon

![Favicon](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-favicon-screenshot.png)

The favicon for the site was created using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) and uses the pink and black colours from the site's colour scheme.

### About

The About section is divided into two divs, which appear side-by-side on tablet-size screens (768px and larger).

#### Main Image

![Main Image](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-main-image.png)

This photo of Joana was chosen as it is striking yet simple with no background clutter.

#### About Me section

![About Me](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-about-me.png)

This is divided into two divs which always appear on top of each other.  The About Me paragraph is a short summary of Joan's appearance and experience.  Underneath is her Showreel, which gives an audiovisual display of her work.

### Resumé

![Resumé](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-resume.png)

The Resumé section details Joan's extensive experience.  It is displayed as one column on screens smaller than 576px and as three columns on larger screens.

### Gallery

![Gallery](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-gallery.png)

The Gallery contains snapshots of Joan in various acting and modelling roles.  It will display as 1-4 columns depending on the screen size.

### Contact Form

#### Mobile
![Contact Form for Mobile](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-contact-form-mobile.png)

#### Desktop
![Contact Form for Desktop](documentation/feature-screenshots/joan-fleetwood-contact-form-desktop.png)

The Contact Form has an icon of a clapperboard and a background of studio lights to emphasise the connection between Joan and the acting world.


### Future Implementations


### Accessibility

I have tried to make the site as accessible as possible.  Steps that I have been conscious to take are:

* Using semantic HTML
* Choosing fonts that are dyslexia-friendly
* Using descriptive alt attributes on all images 
* Providing aria-labels for screen readers where there are icons used and no text, i.e. the social media icons in the footer
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site


## Technologies Used

### Browser Compatibility

The website was tested on:
* Chrome
* Edge
* Safari
* Firefox
* Chrome for Android

### Responsiveness

The site was tested on the following devices: 
* Samsung S9
* Samsung Galaxy S22
* Google Pixel 6
* iPad Pro 2020
* 15.6" Laptop
* Desktop PC

It was extensively tested in Chrome Dev Tools for responsiveness from 300px - 5000px.

### HTML and CSS Validation

I used the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to validate the site and to ensure there were no syntax errors contained therein.

#### HTML

The site initially failed the validation as there were two issues - both related to using HTML rather than CSS for styling. These were fixed easily by using deleting the relevant HTML and using CSS instead.

![HTML fail](documentation/testing/joan-fleetwood-w3c-html-validation-fail-28.4.24.png)


The site now passes the HTML Validation test.

![HTML pass](documentation/testing/joan-fleetwood-html-checker-pass.png)


#### CSS

The site initially failed the validation as there was one issue - this was easily fixed by changing padding-top to padding in one of the elements. 

![CSS fail](documentation/testing/joan-fleetwood-w3c-css-validation-fail-29.4.24.png)

The site now passes the CSS Validation test.

![CSS pass](documentation/testing/joan-fleetwood-css-checker-pass.png)


### Lighthouse

I used the Chrome extension Lighthouse to test the site, particularly for Performance and Accessibility.  Results below.

![Lighthouse results](documentation/testing/joan-fleetwood-lighthouse-webp.webp)


### Solved Bugs

* The original colour scheme for the site used a lighter pink than the current one.  When I tested it on the [achecks.org](https://www.achecks.org/apca-wcag-3-accessible-colour-contrast-checker/) accessibility tester, this colour caused the site to fail as it did not provide enough contrast on the smaller headings or on the 'submit' button against the grey background.  I used [Deque Univerity;s site](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/color-contrast) to find a different shade of the pink colour that would meet accessibility standards.  I also changed the font-weight of the headers to make them easier to read.  These measures solved the issue.

* I had difficulty moving the hamburger menu item into the position it has now.  I tried to use every combination of padding and margin to achieve this but I was unsuccessful.  My mentor Brian Macharia instructed me in changing the background colour of the divs to red to be able to see what was happening.  It turned out that I had set the {align-items} value to baseline rather than center, which was the source of all the issues.  The hamburger menu icon is now where I want it to be.

* I initially used <br> elements for spacing in the index.html, which was pointed out by my mentor as it would mean failing the W3C validation on testing.  I removed these and used CSS to achieve the desired result instead.
